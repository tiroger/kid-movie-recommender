**Project Motivation** | The Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) rating system assigns ratings to movies based on their content, with G (General Audiences) and PG (Parental Guidance Suggested) being the ratings most commonly used for movies aimed at children. However, the MPAA rating system can be somewhat subjective, with different people having different interpretations of what constitutes G or PG-rated content. This can lead to confusion among parents and caregivers who are trying to make informed decisions about what movies are appropriate for their children. There have also been instances where movies with similar content have been given different ratings. For example, some people have argued that some PG-rated movies contain more intense or mature content than some R-rated movies. Finally, the MPAA rating system does not take into account other factors that may be important to parents, such as the quality of the movie, the complexity of the plot, the potential impact on a child's emotional development, or the length of the movie. For these reasons, parents and caregivers may benefit from having access to a more objective and comprehensive system for rating movies based on their suitability for children.

The Kids-In-Mind movie database aims to address these issues by providing detailed information about the content of movies, including violence, sex, and language, to help parents make informed decisions about what movies are appropriate for their children. The website rates movies on a scale of 0-10 in three categories: Sex/Nudity, Violence/Gore, and Profanity. 

**Project Overview** | The aim of this project was to explore whether I could build a recommendation engine that would recommend movies to parents and caregivers based on the content of the movies, as well as other factors such as the age-appropriateness of the movie, the quality of the movie, and the length of the movie. I used the Kids-In-Mind movie database to collect information about the content of movies, and I used the TMDB website to collect information about the quality of movies, and the length of movies.

The final dataset contains information about ~4,700 movies, and includes the following variables:
['movie_title', 'movie_year', 'movie_rating', 'sex_nudity', 'violence_gore', 'language', 'movie_description', 'genre_1', 'genre_2', 'overview', 'vote_average', 'run_time']
